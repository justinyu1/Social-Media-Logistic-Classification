# Social-Media-Logistic-Classification
Used logistic regression models (k-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest) to classify whether or not an individual purchased a brand new car that was shown on a social media platform. I classified the participants in the study based on their age and estimated salaries. The two results were either yes - they purchased the car or no -they did not purchase the car. I viewed the correct number of predictions by constructing a confusion matrix and plotted the boundaries of the classifications using matplotlib. 

The kernel SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers were the most effective in classifying the correct number of yes and no customers (about 90% accuracy), while minimizing overfitting. The decision tree and random forest models were the most accurate (92% accuracy), however, the models overfitted the data set. In conclusion, I would deploy the kernel SVM or the Naive Bayes for a larger version of this data set with more features and participants.
